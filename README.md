# WeaviMovie

This web application recommends movies based on user queries. The search features utilize AI semantic search, enabling the application to understand the meaning of queries. This approach is more advanced than traditional keyword searches. Relevant movies are identified using the Weaviate client with vector embeddings. Initially, a Weaviate database was created with movies info and by vectorizing movie information such as overviews, genres, and release dates. The OpenAI model is employed for vectorization. When searching for a movie, the Weaviate NearText operator calculates the distance between the query vector and the movies vectors. Movies with lower distance values are then returned.
