# WeaviMovie

This web application recommends movies based on user queries. Relevant movies are identified using the Weaviate client with vector embeddings. Initially, a Weaviate database was created by vectorizing movie information such as overviews, genres, and release dates. The OpenAI model is employed for vectorization. When searching for a movie, the NearText operator calculates the distance between the query vector and the movie vectors. Movies with lower distance values are then returned.
